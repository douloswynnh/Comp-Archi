I believe this code is 100% successful. I reused most of the code from
http://www.cs.uml.edu/~bill/cs305/Assignment_7_help.txt and implemented 
the switch cases for error, parent and child. The switch code is pretty 
similar to the one that is commented out and the professor explained in-
depth how each switch cases should output.I changed PARENT to CHILD in 
printf statements, made a makefile for compiling, output.txt for the output
 and a7.c file that includes the whole code.
