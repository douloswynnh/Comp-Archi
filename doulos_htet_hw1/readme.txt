COMP 3050 Computer Architecture							Doulos Htet
Assignment #1 September 1, 2022				

	I am confident that this assignment 1 is working properly with 100% success since it's 
the first and probably the easiest assignment for this class. I mostly reused code from 
professor's convert_float_to_bits.txt and made some changes to the printf statements. I take 
allocated mantissa, exponent and sign from f_bits struct within float_32 union to get those 
respective values and iterate specific position from bit_string to show as binary numbers. I 
also pad the strings to be identical with the example output.  No parts weren't solved.
