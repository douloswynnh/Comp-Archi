COMP 3050 Computer Architecture							Doulos Htet
Assignment #2 September 8, 2022				

	I am confident that this assignment 2 is working properly with 100% success.I mostly 
reused code from professor's Assignment_2_help.pdf and made some changes below to the printf 
statements to match the format professor wanted in instructions. I took float_32_rslt to print
out result bit string. I stored that value as int in floating_value_as_int and recalled it 
using floating_value_in_32_bits for emulated result. The hardware result is calculated by adding
two input values. I also set mantissa value to 0 if the exponent value is 255 to make sure it 
prints inf instead of nan. 

No parts weren't solved.
