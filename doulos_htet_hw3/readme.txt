COMP 3050 Computer Architecture							Doulos Htet
Assignment #3 September 27, 2022				

	I am confident that this assignment 3 is working properly with 100% success.I reused 
code from professor's driver code - ifib.asm and made some changes in FIB microcode command 
with new recurisve version and added some comments to it. FIB loads arguments from AC and 
tests whether it's 0 or 1 and return it accordingly. For any other values, subtract 1 from it 
and go down (n-1) recursive path first, then load the (n-2) path again with FIB command to add 
those two values at the bottom beform returning the result. 


No parts weren't solved.
